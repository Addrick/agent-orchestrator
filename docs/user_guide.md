# User Guide

This document describes the user-facing behavior of the bot. It serves as both a reference for end users and a living spec for new features — describe behavior here before implementing it.

## Interfaces

### Discord

**Persona routing:** Messages are matched to personas in two ways:
1. **Prefix:** Start your message with a persona name followed by a space (e.g., `joy create a ticket for...`). The prefix is stripped before processing.
2. **Channel name:** If no prefix matches, the bot checks if the channel name starts with a persona name (case-insensitive). The full message is sent.

If neither matches, the message is ignored (unless in an ambient logging channel).

**Dev commands:** Commands like `set`, `what`, `detail`, etc. are handled before the LLM is invoked. Responses are sent as threaded replies on the original message (auto-archive after 60 minutes). Mutating commands (e.g., `set model`) also add a checkmark reaction.

**Confirmation flow:** When a persona is in CONFIRM mode and the LLM requests a write tool:
1. The bot presents the tool call details and adds checkmark/X reactions
2. The user reacts to approve or deny
3. On approval, the tool executes and the LLM generates a follow-up response
4. Timeout: 5 minutes (300 seconds)

**Ambient logging:** Messages in configured channels (default: "general", "random", "development") are logged to the database under persona "ambient" without triggering any response. Useful for building conversational context.

**Message deletion:** Deleting a message in Discord automatically suppresses it from future LLM context (the DB row is flagged, not deleted).

**Character limits:** Messages over 2000 characters are automatically split across multiple messages.

**Status:** Bot status shows `as persona1, persona2, ... eye-emoji` (truncated at 128 chars). During generation, status briefly shows the active persona name.

### Gmail (Proof of Concept)

> **Note:** The Gmail interface is a proof of concept and has not been fully designed. The behavior described here reflects current implementation but is subject to significant change.

**Persona routing:** Extracted from the recipient email prefix (e.g., `support-joy@example.com` routes to persona "joy"). Falls back to default persona if unparseable.

**Current behavior:**
- CONFIRM mode is automatically downgraded to AUTONOMOUS (no interactive approval possible via email)
- No conversation persistence (messages are not logged to the database)
- Only processes emails from allowed senders (configurable via `BLOCK_EXTERNAL_SENDER_REPLIES` and `ALLOWED_SENDER_LIST`)
- Uses Google Pub/Sub watch on INBOX for near-instant processing

## Commands

All commands are entered as the message body when addressing a persona. Commands are case-insensitive.

### Conversation Control

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `hello` | Start a dynamic context conversation. Context window grows by 2 messages per turn. |
| `goodbye` | End dynamic context mode and revert to the persona's static default context length. |

### Querying Persona State

`what <attribute>` — Display the current value of a persona attribute.

| Attribute | Shows |

| `memory_mode <mode>` | See Memory Modes below | History retrieval scope |
| `service_bindings <list\|none>` | Comma-separated service names | e.g., `set service_bindings zammad,agents` |

### Persona Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `add <name> [prompt]` | Create a new persona. Default prompt: "you are in character as {name}" |
| `delete <name>` | Remove a persona permanently |
| `remember <text>` | Append text to the persona's system prompt (cumulative) |
| `detail` | Dump full persona configuration (all parameters, tools, bindings) |

### Debugging

| `dump_last` | Summary of the last API request (model, context size, tools, generation params) |
| `dump_context` | Full context dump as downloadable file (config, tools, conversation history) |
| `help` | Show command list and active personas |
| `update_models` | Refresh available model list from configuration |

## Personas

Personas are stateful LLM configuration objects. Each persona has its own model, system prompt, token limits, sampling parameters, tool access, and memory scope. Users interact with personas through the routing mechanisms described above.

### Default Personas

These ship with the bot (defined in `config/default_personas.json`):

| Name | Model | Purpose | Execution Mode | Tools |
|------|-------|---------|----------------|-------|
| arbitr | gemini-2.5-flash | Directive communication, Discord markdown only | AUTONOMOUS | google_grounding_search |
| joy | gemini-2.5-flash | Production Zammad ticket management | CONFIRM | All (zammad + agents bindings) |
| it-help | gemini-2.5-flash | Testing/dev persona for Zammad integration | AUTONOMOUS | All |
| gemini | gemini-2.5-flash | General-purpose Gemini | AUTONOMOUS | google_grounding_search |
| chatgpt | gpt-5 | General-purpose GPT | AUTONOMOUS | None |
| claude | claude-haiku-4-5 | General-purpose Claude | AUTONOMOUS | None |
| testr | gemini-2.5-flash | Test persona (responds "success") | AUTONOMOUS | None |

### System Personas

Defined in `config/system_personas.json`. Not directly user-accessible — used internally by agents for analysis tasks:

- **model_selector** — Fuzzy model name matching for `set model`
- **tool_selector** — Fuzzy tool name matching for `set tools`
- **triage_analyst** — Ticket analysis and internal note generation
- **triage_scout** — Keyword extraction from tickets for search
- **triage_filter** — Relevance scoring between historical and new tickets
- **triage_summarizer** — Ticket content compression
- **dispatch_analyst** — Priority assignment and dispatch notification generation

## Execution Modes

Controls how the bot handles LLM-requested tool calls.

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **AUTONOMOUS** | Tools execute immediately. The user sees only the final response. |
| **CONFIRM** | Write tools (create, update, delete) are presented to the user for approval before execution. Read tools execute immediately. On Discord, approval uses reaction buttons with a 5-minute timeout. |

## Memory Modes

Determines which conversation history is loaded into the LLM context window.

| Mode | Scope | Typical Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **CHANNEL_ISOLATED** | Messages in the current channel only (server-aware) | Default. Keeps conversations separate per channel. |
| **SERVER_WIDE** | All messages across the Discord server for this persona | Cross-channel awareness within a team. |
| **PERSONAL** | All messages from the current user, across all channels | Per-user continuity regardless of channel. |
| **GLOBAL** | All messages for this persona, all servers/users | System-wide knowledge. |
| **TICKET_ISOLATED** | Messages tied to a specific Zammad ticket | Ticket-focused context without chat history bleed. |

History is always limited by message count (default: 15, hard cap: 30), not by token count.

## Tools

Tools are capabilities the LLM can invoke during a conversation. Available tools depend on the persona's `enabled_tools` list and `service_bindings`.

### General Tools

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `web_search` | Read | Search the web via DuckDuckGo. Params: `query`, `max_results` (default 5). |
| `google_grounding_search` | Special | Enables Google's native search grounding. Gemini models only. |

### Zammad Tools (requires `service_bindings: ["zammad"]`)

**Read:**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_ticket_details` | Fetch full ticket data by user-facing ticket number |
| `search_tickets` | Search using Zammad query syntax |
| `search_user` | Find user by email or name |

**Write (gated by CONFIRM mode):**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_ticket` | Create a new support ticket |
| `update_ticket` | Modify ticket state, priority, owner, tags |
| `add_note_to_ticket` | Append internal or public note |
| `create_user` | Register a new customer |
| `update_user` | Modify user details |
| `delete_user` | Remove a user (irreversible) |

### Agent Tools (requires `service_bindings: ["agents"]`)

| Tool | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `get_agent_status` | Read | View running state, deploy counts, error rates for agents |
| `get_agent_history` | Read | Recent action log with optional ticket/customer filters |
| `manage_agent` | Write | Start, stop, or restart an agent |

## Agents

Agents are autonomous background workers that run on a schedule without user interaction. They are configured in `config/agents.json`.

### Current Agents

**ZammadBot (triage)** — Polls for new, untagged Zammad tickets and runs a multi-stage AI triage pipeline:
1. Extracts search keywords from the ticket
2. Searches for related historical tickets (global + per-user)
3. Scores historical tickets for relevance
4. Compresses context if needed
5. Generates an analysis and posts it as an internal note
6. Tags the ticket as triaged

**DispatchAgent** — Polls for triaged tickets and routes notifications:
1. Fetches the ticket and triage note
2. LLM assesses priority and generates a summary
3. Sends notification via configured channel (Discord DM, Zammad note, etc.)
4. Tags the ticket as dispatched

### Managing Agents

Personas with `service_bindings: ["agents"]` and the relevant tools enabled can:
- Check status: Ask the persona to check agent status (invokes `get_agent_status`)
- View history: Ask about recent agent actions (invokes `get_agent_history`)
- Control lifecycle: Ask to start/stop/restart an agent (invokes `manage_agent`, requires confirmation in CONFIRM mode)

There is no user-level permission system. Access to tools is controlled entirely by persona configuration (enabled tools and service bindings). Any user who can message a persona inherits that persona's tool access.

Agent configuration (schedule intervals, notification channels, recipients) is driven by `config/agents.json`, not by LLM decisions.

## System Defaults

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Default model | gemini-2.5-flash-lite |
| Default context limit | 15 messages |
| Context hard cap | 30 messages |
| Max tool calls per request | 5 |
| Max response tokens | 4096 |
| Confirmation timeout | 300 seconds (5 min) |
